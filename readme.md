# What is Shitbox?

It's a \<distro independent\>? setup for system(s) that I use

# Why Shitbox?

Vanilla Arch is too boring, I got ptsd from `gcc` with `lto pgo` and `node` with `npm` USE flags for Gentoo, and nix
fucking sucks ass and I hate it even tho I have used it for a while.

# Is it a new Linux distro?

Not yet, atm. At first, it was just a port of my Nixos-config to bash. Now It has my personal stuff (encrypted of
course), my game configs, system configs, mostly everything that I need to reproduce on my/another person's system I try
to put those in here. And everything is mostly automated.

# Should I use it?

I don't think so. If you don't want a setup that's fully like mine, then don't. The scripts aren't hand holding and
wouldn't probably be idiot-proof too. And I don't like to write comments that much and explain stuff.

# Then did you probably direct me here? Or what will I gain from visiting this repo?

If you want to get `inspired` from my configs and scripts, this is the place to do. I still haven't written a guide for
this repo's file structure yet. But I'm sure you can figure it out with some work and a little bit of bash knowledge.
And if I personally have directed you here, then I also probably gave a specific path to you.

# Will you make this a portable new package manager / distro?

If I need to, yes. If I don't, then no. I don't care about you

# Why won't you hold my hand?

Because I'm not interested in a relationship

# Why bash?

Because I fucking can! I previously thought about using Lua, but bash is on like most Linux distro isos (we don't talk
about alpine), so bash it is!

# Why not Ansible or Guix or this and that?

My fucking wish

# Quick install:

This is for me please don't try to install this and nuke your system
